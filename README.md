				!Tasks, ideas to perform!
✓1. The bot's opportunity to write information in one message, not in separated messages, like i've done. *Milana has done this, check the last version. List is used in function "history" to send the whole information in one message.

✓2. The command to get information about weather

✓3. The command to get information about the time between the last message sent and our time *Andrey has done this and Misha has upgraded the func

✓4. Upgrade '/help' . To add new commands in help-info.

Now we have some tasks to upgrade our bot: 
1. Create some buttons for easier communication Misha's done this
2. Func for location and recording it to the file. Guess it can be helpful for the analysis of audience. 
3. Func for the weather and button for it. Misha's done this 
4. Func for koronovirus Misha's done this 
5. Func for money Milana's done this
